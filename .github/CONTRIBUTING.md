# Contributing to util.observable

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dylarcher/util.observable/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dylarcher/util.observable/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue. Please provide a clear description of the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
- Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint` - we'll add this script later).
- Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Styleguide

- All JavaScript must adhere to [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) (or we can decide on another style guide and enforce with ESLint/Prettier).

We look forward to your contributions!

**Note:** Replace `USERNAME/REPO` with the actual GitHub username and repository name. I'll make a note to ask the user for this information later if they want to update these placeholders.
