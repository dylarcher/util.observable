## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security bugs in `util.observable` seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at `dylarcher@gmail.com`.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
