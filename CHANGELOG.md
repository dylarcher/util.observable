**Note:** I'll remind the user to update `YYYY-MM-DD` for version 1.0.0 and to maintain this file for future releases. The "Unreleased" section is where new changes for the _next_ version will be listed. Since I'm setting up the repo now, many of the "Added" items in "Unreleased" describe the work I'm currently doing. This is standard practice.
